Hej,

Well done and great that you have extra functions and tests as well as a very informative readme file and overall great documentation!
Last but not least, your code seems to work exactly as expected.

There is only one problem: redundancy in the time dictionary! For example, you stored both the time it takes to go from Kviberg to Bellevue and the time it takes to do the exact opposite. We are accepting this kind of solutions as they are when this is the only issue, but do fix that as you work on the rest of the project.
